# Functions for SSVT Lib
A library of example functions and provided material by the book and course material for the Software Specification Verification and Testing (SSVT) Course for the master software engineering. The exam was open book and open internet so I aimed to provide some helpful functions to make programming on the exam faster by putting everything in a single place.
